This project demo showcases a comprehensive solution aimed at addressing the pressing issue of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) in bee populations. Leveraging advanced technologies such as image recognition, deep learning, and real-time monitoring systems, this project offers a user-friendly web platform for beekeepers to monitor bee health and hive conditions. The demo includes code for deep-learning models responsible for predicting bee health, classifying bee subspecies, and assessing hive health based on uploaded images. Additionally, the project integrates an Arduino-based monitoring system to track environmental parameters within the beehive, providing valuable insights for proactive hive management. With detailed instructions provided in the README file, the demo highlights the project's potential to empower beekeepers with actionable tools for preserving bee populations and promoting environmental sustainability.
Steps to run the project:-
1) Download requirements.txt
2) Run the DL (ipynb codes) and generate the H5 file
3) Run Full_proj.ino after developing the Arduino Hardware setup.
4) Run app. and update the COM port number accordingly in the Flask Code.
